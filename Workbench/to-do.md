# To Do
- Replace recognized colors with Akira colors from found-colors.css
  - Note: The format is ARGB, so you'll have to use regex to skip an optional group of 2 characters when looking for the target colors.
- Tweak the code editor to be more Akira-like 
- Explore GMS2 and determine what work remains
